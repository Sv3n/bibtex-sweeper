# bibtex-sweeper
Clean bibtex entries, fix errors, protect acronyms and more!

## Goal
The main purpose of this tool is to take a large, slightly unorganized and perhaps inconsistent bibtex file, and filter it down to a smaller consistent one, that can easily be used in publications. It essentially applies several filtering steps to achieve this goal.
